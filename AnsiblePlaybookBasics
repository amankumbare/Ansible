The playbook concept is at the heart of Ansible. Writing a playbook to configure a system to the desired state is what makes this exercise so valuable to students who are wanting to get serious with Ansible. After completing this learning activity on how to configure an inventory all the way through to a mass software deployment


1. Create an Inventory in `/home/ansible/inventory `That Contains a Host Group Named `web`. The `web` Group Should Contain `node1` and `node2`

echo "[web]" >> /home/ansible/inventory
echo "node1" >> /home/ansible/inventory
echo "node2" >> /home/ansible/inventory
check_circle


2. Create a Playbook in `/home/ansible/web.yml`

a. Configure the Playbook to Install `httpd` on the `web` Group
Using a text editor, such as vim, edit /home/ansible/web.yml to contain the following text block below the line containing "---":

- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: install httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=latest


b. Configure the Playbook to Start and Enable the `httpd` Service on the `web` Group

Using a text editor such as vim, edit /home/ansible/web.yml to contain the following task block after the "install httpd task":

    - name: start and enable httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started enabled=yes

3. Configure the Playbook to Retrieve the Website from *http://repo.example.com/website.tgz* on Each Server in the `web` Group

Using a text editor such as vim, edit /home/ansible/web.yml to contain the following task block after the "start and enable httpd" task:

    - name: retrieve website from repo
      get_url: url=http://repo.example.com/website.tgz dest=/tmp/website.tgz

4. Configure the Playbook to Unarchive the Website into `/var/www/html` on All Servers in the `web` Group

Using a text editor such as vim, edit /home/ansible/web.yml to contain the following task block after the "retrieve website from repo" task:

    - name: install website
      unarchive: remote_src=yes src=/tmp/website.tgz dest=/var/www/html/


5. Dry run to check :

[ansible@amankumbare1c ~]$ ansible-playbook -C web.yml
ERROR! Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  could not find expected ':'

The error appears to be in '/home/ansible/web.yml': line 10, column 8, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

    url=http://repo.example.com/website.tgz dest=/tmp/website.tgz
       ^ here

There appears to be both 'k=v' shorthand syntax and YAML in this task. Only one syntax may be used.


5. Verify the Work by Executing the Playbook Using the Inventory

$ ansible-playbook -i /home/ansible/inventory /home/ansible/web.yml
