Advanced error handling is one of the many strengths of Ansible. 

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_blocks.html#blocks-error-handling

1. Create a playbook: `/home/ansible/report.yml`

echo "---" >> /home/ansible/report.yml


2. Configure the Playbook to Download *http://apps.l33t.com/transaction_list* to `/home/ansible/transaction_list` on `localhost` and Outputs the Message "File downloaded." to `stdout`

Using a text editor, such as vim, edit /home/ansible/report.yml to contain the following text block below the line containing "---":

- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: download tranaction_list
      get_url:
        url: http://apps.l33t.com/transaction_list 
        dest: /home/ansible/transaction_list
    - debug: msg="File downloaded"

3. Configure the Playbook to Handle Connection Failure by Outputting "l33t.com appears to be down. Try again later." to `stdout`

Using a text editor, such as vim, edit the tasks section in /home/ansible/report.yml to contain the new lines as shown below. Note that the get_url line was changed to include a leading hyphen:

---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: download transction_list
      block:
        - get_url:
            url: http://apps.l33t.com/transaction_list
            dest: /home/ansible/transaction_list
        - debug: msg="File downloaded"
      rescue:
        - debug: msg="l33t.com appears to be down.  Try again later."

4. Configure the Playbook to Output "Attempt Completed" to `stdout`, Whether It Was Successful or Not

Using a text editor, such as vim, edit the tasks section in /home/ansible/report.yml to contain the new lines as shown below.

---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: download transction_list
      block:
        - get_url:
            url: http://apps.l33t.com/transaction_list
            dest: /home/ansible/transaction_list
        - debug: msg="File downloaded"
      rescue:
        - debug: msg="l33t.com appears to be down.  Try again later."
      always:
        - debug: msg="Attempt completed."

5. Configure the Playbook to Replace All Instances of `#BLANKLINE` with the Line Break Character `\n`

Using a text editor, such as vim, edit the block section in /home/ansible/report.yml to contain the new lines as shown below:

---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: download transction_list
      block:
        - get_url:
            url: http://apps.l33t.com/transaction_list
            dest: /home/ansible/transaction_list
        - replace: 
            path: /home/ansible/transaction_list 
            regexp: "#BLANKLINE"
            replace: '\n'
        - debug: msg="File downloaded"
      rescue:
        - debug: msg="l33t.com appears to be down.  Try again later."
      always:
        - debug: msg="Attempt completed."


6. Verify Configuration by Running the Playbook

ansible-playbook /home/ansible/report.yml
